XALT: Tracking User Job-level Activity on Clusters

Purpose:

XALT is a tool for sites to collect and understand what users are
running on their cluster.  It tracks the executables and libraries
that users run.  It can be tied to the module system to know what
modules are being used as well.


Overview:

The way that XALT collects data is that it provides a wrapper around
the linker (ld) and the parallel job launcher (aprun, ibrun, mpirun,
etc).  XALT knows the names of the executables and the names of the
static and dynamic libraries that are part of the executable through
the ld wrapper.  Then for parallel jobs it knows what programs are run
and how they were run (Number of Nodes, etc) as well as the
environment.  Each link and run are written to a database for further
analysis. With this information sites can know exactly what types of
executables and from what fields of science.
