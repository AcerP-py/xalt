Ideas for BoF at ISC 17

* XALT -> Track programs and libraries that get run on your cluster.
* It is a census taker, not a performance tool.
* IT is battle tested:  Run at TACC, KAUST, NICS, ORNL, UK Archer
* XALT 2 -> track all executables not just MPI programs
* Site control of what programs gets tracked and which machines
* SQL database work great for all but the biggest sites
** Working on different DB's to handle the bigish data
* Future work:  Track more things: python, R, MATLAB, what else?
* discussion: Stories? What would you like to know?
