{\bf{}Title:} Job-Level Tracking with XALT: A Tutorial for System Administrators and Data Analysts

~~


\noindent
{\bf{}Abstract:}


% 200 words

Let’s talk real, no-kiddin’ supercomputer analytics, aimed at moving
beyond monitoring the machine as a whole or even its individual
hardware components. We’re interested in drilling down to the level of
individual batch submissions, users, and binaries. We’re after ready
answers to the "what, where, how, when and why" that stakeholders are
clamoring for – everything from which libraries (or individual
functions!) are in demand to preventing the problems that get in the
way of successful science. This tutorial will show how to install and
set up the XALT tool that can provide this type of job-level insight.
 
The XALT tool can provide a wide range of metrics and measures of
job-level activity. There are benefits to users and stakeholders:
sponsoring institutions interested in strategic priorities;
organizations concerned about meeting users’ needs; and those seeking
to study user activity to improve value and effectiveness.
 
We will show how to install and configure XALT. We will also show how
this tool provides high value to centers and their users as it can
provide documentation on how an application was built to provide
reproducibility.

This tutorial will show how to install and configure XALT – a tool for
drilling down to the level of individual batch submissions, users, and
binaries. We’re after ready answers to the "what, where, how, when and
why" that stakeholders are clamoring for – everything from which
libraries (or individual functions!) are in demand to preventing the
problems that get in the way of successful science. We will show how
the XALT tool can be used to provide attention across a wide range of
metrics and measures of job-level activity. We see potential benefits
to stakeholders beyond just end users: sponsoring institutions
interested in strategic priorities and scientific impact; support
organizations and development teams concerned about meeting users’
needs and expectations; and those seeking to study user activity to
improve value and effectiveness. We will also show how XALT provides
high value to users as it can provide complete documentation on how an
application was built and when it was run; whenever you want to figure
it out again. This provides a key piece of the reproducibility
needs. We will also discuss how this can be a valuable tool for
security reasons again due to the tracking of shared (and static)
libraries in an application over time. 

The proposers bring to the table passion and experience improving the
end-user experience. Both Fahey and McLay are actively engaged in work
focused on job-level activity. Dr. Fahey is the author of ALTD, a tool
that reports software and library usage at the individual job
level. Dr. McLay is the author of Lmod, an innovative environmental
module system with numerous features that facilitate job-level
analysis and protect the user from common configuration problems. Both
tools are currently deployed at numerous major centers across the
United States and Europe. 

The expected outline with time estimations are as follows:
Introduction and Motivation, 20 min Prepare to install, 20 min -
Things to consider Installation, 50 min - Configure, make, install -
Post install changes Break, 15 min Testing, 30 min - Debugging
Production, 30 min - Wrappers - Data transmission Data mining, 40 min

{\bf{}Logistics:}

This is a half-day tutorial.  The material is broken down into 20\%
Beginner, 50\% Intermediate and 30\% Advanced.   Attendees should
bring a laptop to get the full benefit of the tutorial.

{\bf{}Dr. Robert McLay}

Dr. Robert McLay received bachelors and masters degree from the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology and his Ph.D in Engineering Mechanics from The University 
of Texas at Austin.  His research include C++ software development, regression 
testing, and software tools, all related to large parallel numerical simulation codes.  
In particular, he has done work in parallel finite-element programs solving 
incompressible fluid flow and heat transfer.
His interest in software tools and support of HPC programming environments has 
lead to his development of Lmod, a modern replacement for Environment Modules 
system.  Lmod's major advantages are protect all users from loading incompatible 
software without hindering experts.  This work as lead to an interest in tracking the 
software usage through the module system.
