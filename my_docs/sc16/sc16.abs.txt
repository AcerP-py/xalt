Title:     XALT: How to track and understand what your users are running on your system.
Presentor: Robert McLay
Length:    30 mins
Abstract:

Sites typically know how much time and processors use on their system but not what programs
and libraries their users run.  XALT is a extremely lightweight solution to track what your
users do.  Originally XALT could only track MPI programs.  The new XALT tracks both MPI and
non-MPI programs.  Come see how easy it is to better understand what your users are doing.
