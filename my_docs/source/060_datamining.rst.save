Data Mining
============

We are currently creating a series of standard queries for mining XALT data.  The following is a collection of options for generating reports based on our initial needs 

Module File Usage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Example::

    mysql>
    SELECT xalt_object.module_name,
    count(xalt_run.date) AS Jobs,
    ROUND(SUM(run_time*num_cores)/3600) as TotalSUs FROM xalt_run,
    xalt_link, join_link_object, xalt_object
    WHERE xalt_run.syshost='darter’
    AND xalt_object.module_name is NOT NULL
    AND xalt_run.uuid = xalt_link.uuid
    AND xalt_link.link_id = join_link_object.link_id
    AND join_link_object.obj_id = xalt_object.obj_id
    AND xalt_run.date >= '2014-11-01’ AND xalt_run.date <= '2014-11-09’
    GROUP BY xalt_object.module_name ORDER BY Jobs DESC;

SQL - from the manual - based on pulling information from darter

This query will return a report first sorted in descending order the most used libraries (objects) for a
specified machine based on number of times it appears in a link::

	mysql> SELECT object_path, module_name, count(date) AS cnt from
	xalt_link, join_link_object, xalt_object where build_syshost='darter'
	AND xalt_link.link_id = join_link_object.link_id AND
	join_link_object.obj_id = xalt_object.obj_id GROUP BY object_path
	ORDER BY cnt DESC;

Occurrences of the modulefile name::

	mysql> SELECT module_name, count(date) AS cnt from xalt_link,
	join_link_object, xalt_object where build_syshost='darter' AND
	xalt_link.link_id = join_link_object.link_id AND
	join_link_object.obj_id = xalt_object.obj_id GROUP BY module_name
	ORDER BY cnt DESC;

Occurrences of the modulefile name without NULL module_name entries included::

	mysql> SELECT module_name, count(date) AS cnt from xalt_link,
	join_link_object, xalt_object where build_syshost='darter' AND
	module_name is not NULL AND xalt_link.link_id =
	join_link_object.link_id AND join_link_object.obj_id =
	xalt_object.obj_id GROUP BY module_name ORDER BY cnt DESC;

Report of modulefile usage based on shared library usage at run time
ordered by number of occurrences used::

	mysql> SELECT xalt_object.module_name, count(date) AS Jobs,
	ROUND(SUM(run_time*num_cores)/3600) as TotalSUs from xalt_run,
	join_run_object, xalt_object where xalt_run.syshost='mars' AND
	xalt_object.module_name is NOT NULL AND xalt_run.run_id =
	join_run_object.run_id AND join_run_object.obj_id =
	xalt_object.obj_id AND date >= '2014­11­01' AND date <= '2014­11­09'
	GROUP BY xalt_object.module_name ORDER BY Jobs DESC;

Counts of the module files based on static library usage at
runtime::

	mysql> SELECT xalt_object.module_name, count(xalt_run.date) AS Jobs,
	ROUND(SUM(run_time*num_cores)/3600) as TotalSUs from xalt_run,
	xalt_link, join_link_object, xalt_object where
	xalt_run.syshost='darter' AND xalt_object.module_name is NOT NULL AND
	xalt_run.uuid = xalt_link.uuid AND xalt_link.link_id =
	join_link_object.link_id AND join_link_object.obj_id =
	xalt_object.obj_id AND xalt_run.date >= '2014­11­01' AND
	xalt_run.date <= '2014­11­09' GROUP BY xalt_object.module_name ORDER
	BY Jobs DESC;
