Notes for Feb 23 XALT Zoom Mtg

* Talk about how to filter based on arguments
* In all cases the path to the program must pass the normal filtering
  In other words, if one is filtering python arguments, then the
  program python must pass as well.
* One approach: Provide a interface for a C routine/C library to handle the arguments
  This is similar to the host name filtering provided
* Second approach provide a Flex interface for arguments
** Take the command line and skip all arguments that start with "-"
** Take all other arguments, try abspath conversion then hand them off to a flex pattern matching

* Issues:
** command line parsing is a PITA.  
** Sure it is possible to do it once but keeping it up-to-date is tough!!!
** My reading of python command line arguments are
   That all command arguments are only flags
   The options do not take a value.
* Path foo will be required
  ./try.py doesn't always expand to /full/path/try.py
