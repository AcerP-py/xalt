Notes for June 15th meeting:

Announcing XALT 3.0 Release:

All the important changes from XALT 2.0

* XALT 2.0 release:
** Switched from using mpirun/ibrun etc to track only mpi executions
** To using ELF trick to track all executions
* Major changes from XALT 2.0 to 3.0
** Support for curl transport
** Use of SYSLOG transfer
** Support for writing to a global shared location with hashing directories: 000 to 997
*** Avoids race condition when writing to $HOME/.xalt.d
** Support for XALT_TRACING to debug XALT operations
** Allow sites track or ignore command line
** Support for Tracking whether NVIDIA GPU are used or not.

* Filtering
** Usually to much data from short scalar (non-MPI) executions -> must filter.
** Some users are using short small MPI executions to train Neural nets -> must filter MPI programs
** Must handle long running/non-terminating MPI programs 
** Sampling allows for tracking programs like sed, perl, cp and awk

* Improved Performance
** Stop taking SHA1 of libraries
** Json record from job execution tracking includes timing record
** Full Tracking is less than 0.01 seconds in my tests. 

* Better container support
** copy required libraries (libcrypto, libuuid, libdcgm,  etc) to XALT install directory
** Use dlopen to link to required libraries
** Support for container built with ALPINE ( Non glibc container)

* Better instrumentation for reading in json records with either file or syslog records

* Two useful programs:
** xalt_configuration_report: Report on how XALT is configured for your site
** xalt_extract_record: How and Who and when an execution was built.

* Some UUID implementation can give duplicates
** XALT uses CRC to keep only one of the dups


* XALT used to call a C++ program to generate the json execution record
** A version of MPI prevented any program execution after MPI_Finalize was called.
** This prevented any mpi execution from being tracked.
** Found a C hash table implementation (uthash etc)
*** Not connected to Univ. of Texas!
** Rewrote all the C++ function in C so that there is (almost) no execution called after MPI_Finalize
*** the curl program is the only exception


* I tried to get to XALT to trap signal -> a discussion for later.

* Support for package filtering based on command line arguments

* Support for ARM based linux computers.  Tested on ARM Macs and ARM Nvidia computers.
