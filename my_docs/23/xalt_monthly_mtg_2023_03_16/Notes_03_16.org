Notes for 3/16 XALT zoom mtg

* In the XALT testing branch is the new feature of testing

* It supports "Approach 2" Namely it provides a built-in way to filter on the path and arguments
* It works like this:
** Modify your site config file to have a "CUSTOM" tag for particular executables:
path_patterns = [
    ['CUSTOM,  r'.*\/python[0-9][^/][^/]*'],
    ...
]
** Add new group of patterns:
path_arg_patterns = [
  ['SKIP', r'.*\/python[0-9][^/;][^/;]*;.*\/share\/.*'],
  ['PKGS', r'.*\/python[0-9][^/;][^/;]*;.*\/data\/.*'],
  ['PKGS', r'.*\/python[0-9][^/;][^/;]*;'],
]

The patterns are executable path ";" arg path

Note the change in the way that the executable path is handled

- 1st: skip any python scripts that have /share/ as part of the path
- 2nd: keep any python scripts that have /data/  as part of the path
- 3rd: keep any python scripts that have neither of the above

* Rules:
** Only executable that Have "CUSTOM" as the tag will get filtered
** Can have more that one exectable path that has "CUSTOM"
** For custom tags XALT loops over each argument
*** argument with a leading "-" are ignored
*** argument are then converted to abspath and checked for existance
    non-existance paths are ignored!
** Finally if no matches have been made:
   The pattern with no arguments is tested.
   If this pattern does not exist then the default is SKIP

* False matching

Suspose you have the following command line:

   $ python -z /my/path/share/foo /my/path/data/hello.py

Note that python does NOT currently have arguments that take values,
but it could in the future

But other programs that you wish to filter on argument might

In the following case XALT will skip even though the python script you
would "KEEP"

* Site testing

$ XALT_TRACING=run python /my/path/data/hello_world.py

    track_executable():
    -> arg: 1: value: "../../share/hello_world.py"
    -> pattern: "/usr/bin/python3.10;/home/mclay/w/xalt/testing/rt/end2end/share/hello_world.py", track_executable token: 3: SKIP
share/hello_world.py: Hello World! from  3.10.6
