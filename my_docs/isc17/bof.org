Ideas for BoF at ISC 17

* XALT -> Track programs and libraries that get run on your cluster.
* It is a census taker, not a performance tool.
* It is battle tested:  Run at TACC, KAUST, NICS, ORNL, UK Archer
* Stories:
   Benchmarking next system
   Large memory queue overuse
* XALT 2 -> track all executables not just MPI programs
* Site control of what programs gets tracked and which machines
* Current SQL database work great for all but the biggest sites
   Working on different DB's to handle the bigish big data
* Future work:  Track more things: python, R, MATLAB, what else?
* discussion: What would you like to know? Could XALT help you run your system better?
