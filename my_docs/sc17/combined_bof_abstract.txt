Tracking and Analyzing Job-level Activity using Open XDMoD, XALT and OGRT This BoF is for those interested in the increasingly important need totrack and analyze activity on large-scale systems: usage, performance,and impact, down to the level of each individual job. Open XDMoDprimarily displays aggregated data: it provides your own web portal toview, summarize, and analyze this data. We will discuss recentdevelopments and improvements in XDMoD. XALT and OGRT are aboutcollection: these tools are battle-tested tools focused on job-levelusage data. They track executables and libraries with the lowestpossible overhead. Join us for demos, discussions, and a wide-rangingexchange of information!
