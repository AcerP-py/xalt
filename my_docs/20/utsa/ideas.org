Here are some notes on what I want to talk about with Brent and Team
from UTSA:

* Hi, I'm Robert McLay.  I am the manager of the HPC Software Tools Group
** We have several tools at TACC
*** Lmod: An Environment Module Tools
*** XALT: Software Census Taker on Clusters
*** The startup scripts in /etc/profile.d
*** The user startup scripts defaults: 
     .bashrc, .profile, .cshrc, .login
*** Sanitycheck: A series of automated test:
      ssh keys setup correctly
      not blocked from queues
      not over quota
*** HPC Tips: One tip per login
     Tip 44   (See "module help tacc_tips" for features or how to disable)

        You can create a multiple directories at one time with "mkdir -p a/{d1,d2}/{src,inc}".
        This is the same as "mkdir -p a/d1/src a/d1/inc a/d2/src a/d2/inc".
*** Shell Startup Debug
*** TACC Stats

*** Reframe: CSCS testing tool.

* XALT:
** Brief history
** Show libelf trick
** What questions to you have?
** Documentation: xalt.readthedocs.io
** What will you do with the data?
** What we do with the data.
*** Who is running what particular program
*** GPU usage?
*** Top 20 executable by Core Hours, Num of Users, Num of Times
** Setup:
*** ./configure; make; make install
*** We add xalt to the TACC module that all user load by default.
** syshost name
** XALT data transmission
*** File
*** syslog
*** curl
** The site-config.py file
*** Each site needs to configure their site configuration *.py file
*** Regex patterns to match what hostnames you wish to track: 
     We track execution only on compute nodes
*** path patterns
    PKGS: R, MATLAB, python: we can track "imports"
*** Sample programs like cp, awk, perl
*** Ignore everything else what is in /usr, /bin, etc
*** Ignore compiler, mpiexec etc
*** Configure programs from autoconf, Cmake
** Sampling
*** Scalar Samping
*** MPI sampling versus MPI_ALWAYS_RECORD issue
** Env. Patterns
*** Skip almost all save a few
** Python patterns
