Things to talk about in booth talk on XALT: 

* XALT 2.4 was available for SC 18

* XALT catches signals such as SEGSEGV, SEGFPE

* XALT can used to track executions inside a Singularity container

* Better Support for tracking gpu usage (not performance)

* XALT No longer hard codes paths.  Instead uses /bin:/usr/bin (configure option)

* XALT has fought with libuuid.  Now libuuid is NOT part of user code.

* Many many speed improvement during execution:
** Now reads /proc/$PID/maps for shared libraries (avoid running ldd on executable)
** Now reads XALT watermark directly through a libelf call (Vendor note). 
   This avoid running objdump on executable. 

* Changes in sampling:
   Now all MPI programs are sampled if they are less than 256 tasks
