Here are some notes for my talk at HPCKP'20

XALT:


* What is XALT?
** Tracks program execution on your cluster
** It can track what program run on your system 
** And what libraries
** XALT is a census taker, NOT a performance tool
** Extremely cheap execution penalty (~ 0.001 secs)
** Generate *.json records
** XALT provides a MYSQL database to hold information.
* Brief History 
** XALT was a NSF funded project.
** Work has continued because TACC (and others) have found it useful
** Original version only tracked mpi program execution
* How does it work: Two Parts
** LD wrapper
** ELF trick to record 
* LD wrapper
** Linux compiler call ld to build the executable in an ELF format
** XALT provides an LD wrapper script
*** It injects a watermark that knows the build user, the modules, the machine, ...
*** Records the shared libraries that built the executable
*** Generates a *.json record that can be stored in a database
* ELF Trick
