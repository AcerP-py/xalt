Notes for 12/15 XALT Meeting Presentation: Package tracking:

R tracking is done by including R package tracking (better name)

Python tracking is done by putting xalt's sitecustomize.py in
$PYTHONPATH

Rule:
Don't send anything on the "wire" that you don't have to.

* The way that R packages and Python packages are tracked are by an import hook
** That is when the import statement is run.
** XALT code captures that and generates a package record.
** There is special code that written for R and another for Python
