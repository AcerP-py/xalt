I may reuse eb_user_21 talk.  But is there anything new to report?


* New this year?
** Current Version is 2.10.34
** Last year was 2.10.2
** Will be moving to 3+ but there is no major change between XALT 2.*+ and 3.0

* Internal changes
** Use of crc to prevent dups
** Issue with uuid
   Seems that older systems have problems with dup uuid
   Added crc check to prevent collisions
** Better debugging report for both XALT runs on cluster
   and ingestion of data into db
** pre-ingestion filter
   For sites that need to avoid overloading the VM db
** Adding better compiler detection
   rustc, nim, chpl, ocaml, haskell(ghc)
** Better mpi compiler reporting
   mpiicc(icc) etc.

* Talk about $XALT_TRACING?

* Do I want to talk about XALT bug reports stories?

* Better container support
** Working with Charlie Cloud so that XALT with work with CC

* XALT Monthly Zoom Meetings
** Topics
*** Controlling which executable get tracked
*** Using Lmod to build the reverse map from directories to modules
*** Using $XALT_TRACING to debug XALT
*** How to test XALT at your site
