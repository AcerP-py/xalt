Notes for 3/17 talk

* Remind everyone how XALT works
* Bad memory foo
** Show examples how memory is zero'ed before you get it   
** Show example of dirty memory issue
* Show what XALT does about this
** XALT doesn't normally do any memory allocation for Non-MPI program  
** For MPI program memory is allocated and freed.
   But memory is zeroed before freeing
   Check code:
     1) mininal allocation for non-MPI. Right?
     2) MPI does alot of allocations and freeing
     3) Zero memory before returning through free() 
* Show random linkage
* Show what XALT does about this
