Notes on path_patterns

* XALT can be overwhelmed with data
** Sites must do something to keep the tracking worth while and manageable
** One throughput job ran over 2M times and generated 4.5 days worth of data
** One user used a 4 core MPI program to train at neural network.
** Sampling for both non-mpi (scalar) and mpi programs.

* Three ways to control the recorded data
** Use path_patterns to ignore (AKA SKIP) many executable
** Sampling to reduce the number of executables tracked
** pre-ingest filtering (Only works with storing in the MySQL DB)

* TACC wants to capture science so we track
** user executables 
** system executable that we provide (/opt/apps/*)
** Unix executables like cp, awk, perl, etc. (likely samplied)

* Sites can do anything they like

* Config/TACC_config.py is what we use at TACC
** Select R, MATLAB and python for PKGS that track imports
** Keep cp, sed, awk, perl  from /bin or /usr/bin
** Ignore /bin, /usr/bin, etc.
** Ignore compiler, mpi wrappers, shell scripts
** Ignore test programs generated by autoconf's configure and Cmake.

* Sampling is controlled by interval_array and mpi_interval_array.
