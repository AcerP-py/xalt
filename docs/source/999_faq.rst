==========================

Building the Gnu Compiler gcc/g++ fails under XALT.

   XALT adds a watermark to every executable it build.  Currently
   building gcc etc, builds in multiple stages.  The second to the
   last stage is compared bit-for-bit with the last stage. The
   watermark cause the two stages to be different.  Just remember to
   unload the XALT module before building gcc/g++.
