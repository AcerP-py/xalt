Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Why do I get message that say "... GLIBCXX_3.4.20 not found ..." when
I try to run any application when XALT is active?

    This means that your site has installed an GCC version newer than
    the default gcc installed on the system. Please re-install XALT
    with just the system version of gcc.  If your system gcc is older
    than 4.8.5 (say Centos 6) then please see :ref:`old_gcc-label`
