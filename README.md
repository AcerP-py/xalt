## Synopsis

XALT is a lightweight software tool for any Linux cluster,
workstation, or high-end supercomputer to track executable information
and linkage of static shared and dynamically linked libraries. When
the code is executed, wrappers intercept both GNU linker (ld) to capture
linkage information and environmental variables.

## Creators
Dr. Mark Fahey  
Dr. Robert McLay

## Motivation

We wanted to be able to answer the questions: what software do
researchers actually use on high-end computers, and how successful are
they in their efforts to use it?  With the information that xalt
collects, high-end computer administrators can answer our questons by
tracking continuous job-level information to learn what products
researchers do and do not need.  Drilling down to data driven usage
statistics helps stakeholders conduct business in a more efficient,
effective, and systematic way.

## Commercial Support
Ellexus is providing commercial support.
See https://www.ellexus.com/products/xalt-tracking-job-level-activity-supercomputers if interested.


## Installation and Use of XALT
Documentation is provided at xalt.readthedocs.io on how to install and use XALT.

## ChangeLog

### XALT 2.4:

Bug Fix:

   1. Support for tracking GPU usage with the DCGM library from NVIDIA.
   2. XALT by default only uses LD_PRELOAD to track execution.
   
### XALT 2.3:

Bug Fix:

   1. Fix bug where XALT would miss libraries that depended on LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
   

### XALT 2.2:

Features:

   1. XALT registers a signal handler so that programs that seg-faults, fpe
      and other signals will generate an end record.

   2. XALT now optional supports detecting GPU usage through the NVIDIA DCGM library.

   3. Direct to database option has been removed.

### XALT 2.1:

Features:

   1. XALT can now tracks both MPI and non-MPI programs subject to site controlled filtering
